To run this app:

Install Flask by running pip install flask in your terminal.
Save the code in a Python file (e.g., exercise_tracker.py).

The app consists of two routes:

The '/' route displays the home page (index.html) with a form to log exercises.
The '/log' route handles both GET and POST requests. For GET requests, it reads the exercise log from exercise_log.csv and displays it in the log.html template. For POST requests, it logs a new exercise entry in the CSV file based on the submitted form data.
To run the app, execute python exercise_tracker.py in your terminal. The app will start running on http://localhost:5000. Visit that URL in your browser to access the exercise tracker app.

Note: This is a basic implementation to get you started. You can enhance it by adding validation, authentication, editing or deleting entries, and more, depending on your specific requirements.
