an example of a simple recipe ingredient parser implemented in Python using the NLTK library.
The parse_ingredients function takes a list of ingredients as input and returns a list of parsed ingredients. It tokenizes each ingredient, assigns part-of-speech tags to the tokens, and keeps only nouns (N) and adjectives (J) as parsed tokens. The parsed tokens are then lemmatized (converted to their base form) and joined back into a string.

In the example usage, we provide a list of ingredients and print the parsed version of each ingredient.

Note that this is a basic implementation, depending on your specific needs, you may need to enhance the parser by handling more complex ingredient formats, handling plural/singular forms, handling special cases, and so on.
